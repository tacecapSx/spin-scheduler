# spin-scheduler

v0 -> v1

1. Single-threaded -> Multi-threaded

2. Non-preemptive -> Preemptive

3. Round-robin scheduling -> Priority-based scheduling

4.	Cooperative task switching -> Message-passing model (interprocess communication)

5.	Only if using priority: Verify liveness/deadlock -> Verify also starvation/load balancing
